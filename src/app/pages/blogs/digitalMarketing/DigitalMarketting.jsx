                    due to its remarkable benefits. However, there is still a
                    need to develop a proper digital strategy to perfect a

                    We have developed a 10 step process for creating a unique
                    and effective digital strategy. Don’t worry; the entire
                    process is simple to understand and ideally meets the
                    requirements of all business types.
                  </p>
                  <h4>1- Explain Your ‘Why’</h4>
                  <p>
                    It is quite necessary to identify the purpose of your
                    business. 'Why' you have started your step-up and how it
                    meets users' needs. Once you figured out the purpose of your
                    digital setup, creating engaging messages and captivating
                    content becomes easier.
                  </p>
                  <h4>2- Create a Unique Brand Story</h4>
                  <p>
                    There are thousands of brands working online, but not all of
                    them leave an everlasting impact on customers. So, you have
                    to create a unique brand story that makes you stand
                    different. For instance, Apple Inc's 'Think different' idea
                    always attracts everyone, and people consider its products
                    seriously.
                  </p>
                  <h4>3- Define Your Goals </h4>
                  <p>
                    Starting a business without any definite goal is pretty
                    useless. There should be a strong motive and agenda behind
                    starting this new set-up. For instance, if you are starting
                    an online clothing brand, your business goal should be
                    similar to 'To provide premium-quality attires at affordable
                    prices.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remember; always set SMART (specific, measurable,
                    attainable, relevant, and time-bound) goals for their better
                    accomplishment.
                  </p>
                  <h4>4- Understand Your Audience</h4>
                  <p>
                    If you truly intend to create a difference in the digital
                    world, then understand your audience. Surely, it requires
                    research and brainstorming, but it is worth all your effort.
                  </p>
                  <h4>5- Create Your Journey Map</h4>
                  <p>
                    Once you are sure about your target audience, the next key
                    step is to create a successful journey map. This map helps
                    you identify people who are already interacting with your
                    brand and potential interaction in the future.
                  </p>
                  <h4>6- Identify Major Channels</h4>
                  <p>
                    Here you can start more with the nitty-gritty of the digital
                    world. No denial, the numbers of social and digital channels
                    are increasing with each passing day. Therefore, it is
                    necessary to use a platform that perfectly engages your
                    audience. For example, if your targeted audience uses more
                    Instagram, try to interact with them via this channel.
                  </p>
                  <h4>7- Create Your Content Strategically </h4>
                  <p>
                    Amazingly, content is considered the king of the digital
                    world. That's why; it is somewhat necessary to create
                    digital content that best grabs the attention of potential
                    customers and ideally conveys your message.
                  </p>
                  <h4>8- Draft Your Content Calendar</h4>
                  <p>
                    Always publish your content after contemplating its
                    deliverable and deadline etc. The creation of a draft for
                    your content calendar helps you in managing your content
                    needs.
                  </p>
                  <h4>9- Classify Your Resources</h4>
                  <p>
                    Resource identification is a real need in the digital world.
                    Before your business starts, you have to figure out
                    everything about staff, time, money, and other related
                    factors.
                  </p>
                  <h4>10- Data Measurement</h4>
                  <p>
                    It is quite easy to find out data for your digital
                    marketing. Use different platforms for a better analysis of
                    your business position.
