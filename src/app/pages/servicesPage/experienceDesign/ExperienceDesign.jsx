                    A digital platform’s strategy, design, and development must
                    all promote one goal: creating a valuable, memorable
                    experience for the user. We create experiences that connect
                    deeply with your target audience’s needs, and inspire not
                    just affection, but action.

                  <h3>Why UX is a brand and business need</h3>
                  <p>
                    It’s human nature: people like things to be easy and clear.
                    And today, people have seamless user experiences at their
                    fingertips, every minute of every day. Expectations are
                    high.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So when a digital property isn’t easy to use, people get
                    frustrated. And when they get frustrated, they go elsewhere
                    – leaving with a poor impression of your business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The good news is that building a great user experience takes
                    work, but it’s not magic. You need the right expertise, a
                    passion for listening to your users, and a willingness to
                    test and learn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experts on Blue Fountain Media’s UX team bring all of
                    those qualities and more. It’s their job to turn the
                    frustration of “what’s going on?” into the joy of “that was
                    easy” – designing standout experiences that convert
                    prospects and keep customers coming back.

                  <h3>Why website design matters</h3>
                  <p>
                    A website is a brand touchpoint, a business tool, and a
                    place to drive critical conversions. A great website can be
                    an engine of business growth. A poor site can inflict damage
                    on your brand..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But outstanding web design isn’t easy. Today’s audiences
                    have high expectations. You have seconds – maybe
                    milliseconds – to convince visitors that your site is worth
                    their time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With over 17 years of experience, Blue Fountain Media
                    creates websites to exceed audience expectations. We build
                    sites to perform with a focus on strategic planning,
                    compelling visual design, and flawless user experience, in
                    order to drive superior results.

                  <h3>Navigating the Mobile-First Era</h3>
                  <p>
                    Practically overnight, mobile has become the primary way
                    users engage digitally. And today, audiences judge brands by
                    the quality of the experience they provide. Without a
                    seamless mobile experience, you risk being written off as a
                    waste of time and space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Apps are not the only way to conquer mobile, but they’re a
                    powerful tool – they’re natively mobile, offer broad
                    capabilities, and give you a permanent presence on devices
                    your customers check over 50 times a day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With nearly two decades of experience in digital, the BFM
                    team understands what goes into truly intuitive and engaging
                    mobile experiences. For clients ready to break into the app
                    marketplace, we’re an end-to-end partner for mobile
                    experience design.

                  <h4>Designing for the user</h4>
                  <p>
                    Downloading a mobile app is a commitment. If consumers are
                    going to find your app and integrate it into their routine,
                    the experience must keep them coming back. That starts and
                    ends with the user:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Listen to the user.</strong> Your app design agency
                    should be invested in understanding the needs of users, and
                    how your app might meet those needs. Otherwise, there’s no
                    reason to believe people will use it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Design for user needs.</strong> Naturally, you want
                    your app to look good. But great app design never
                    complicates things; it gets out of the way and lets users do
                    what they need to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Test with real users.</strong> You never really know
                    until you test. Once your agency thinks they have everything
                    just right, they should be letting users go hands-on with
                    the product and prove them wrong. This feedback is key for
                    designing an app that actually understands its audience.

                  <h3>Why eCommerce website design matters</h3>
                  <p>
                    Creating custom experiences is key to winning customers’
                    hearts – and seizing market share. When the right products,
                    design, features, and branding come together, users have
                    more excuses to stick around – and more reasons to buy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We’ve been designing high-performing websites for over 17
                    years, and eCommerce sites are at the core of our expertise.
                    We’re focused on creating strategic, compelling designs that
                    deliver unique experiences, driving purchases and bringing
                    users back again and again.

                  <h3>Success in Understanding</h3>
                  <p>
                    For global brands, every new market is a new test. What
                    works in New York won’t work in Paris; what works in Paris
                    might not resonate in Buenos Aires. Business leaders
                    understand this, implementing localization practices across
                    global markets. Every choice matters for a brand, and the
                    stakes are high.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But true localization, the kind that shows real cultural
                    literacy, is a complex equation of messaging, UX, and
                    strategy. Fostering a global brand is all about stepping
                    into your users’ shoes and understanding what fuels their
                    interest. That’s a marketing problem. So, get marketers to
                    solve it.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s why BFM has developed Global Experience Assessment: a
                    unique hybrid program that merges testing, data science, and
                    market research to drive localization efforts and build
                    brands that earn affection the world over.

                  <p>

                    parent company, putting hundreds of thousands of global

                  <p>
                    Customers respond to what’s relevant. Ensuring they only see
                    relevant products and content on your digital platforms
                    requires analytical savvy and quality data. And if you’re
                    investing in AI, a model that’s learning from bad data can
                    be worse than useless.

                    Delivering relevant – and ultimately, intelligent –
                    experiences demands unrelenting attention to data quality.
                    But typically, data curation is no one’s job.

                    As a result, curation either becomes an ungainly ad hoc
                    program, forces high-skill talent into repetitive work, or
                    simply doesn’t get done. In these cases, getting your data
                    unstuck requires help.
